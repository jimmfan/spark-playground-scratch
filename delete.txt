I appreciate the feedback and the recognition of my technical contributions and innovation efforts. However, I would like to express some concerns regarding my final rating, as I believe it does not fully align with my impact on the team and the feedback I received throughout the year.

1. Technical Contributions & Business Value
Throughout the year, I consistently took on and resolved complex technical challenges that no one else on the team had the expertise to handle. These efforts directly contributed to the team's efficiency, automation capabilities, and our ability to scale solutions. While my work was often deeply technical, it ultimately provided clear business value, improving processes and enabling better decision-making.


2. Alignment with Feedback Received
Throughout the year, I received positive feedback indicating that my contributions were highly valued, and I was encouraged to work on initiatives I found meaningful because my work consistently delivered impact. This messaging made the final rating unexpected, as it does not reflect the support and encouragement I received.


3. Commitment to Growth
I recognize the importance of balancing technical depth with business acumen, governance, and communication. While I have taken steps in these areas, I am open to further improving how I align my work with business priorities, communicate progress, and integrate audit standards into my approach. I would appreciate clearer expectations and opportunities to apply these aspects in a way that strengthens both my contributions and the teamâ€™s objectives.



I value the opportunity to contribute to the team and am committed to continuous growth. However, I believe my rating should more accurately reflect the impact I made this year. I welcome a conversation to discuss this further and better understand the expectations moving forward.
