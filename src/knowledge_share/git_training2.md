🎬 1. Opening Story + What Are Git and GitHub? (3 min)

The Problem That Sparked Git

In 2005, Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, had a problem. Linux is an operating system, and the Linux kernel is the part of it that makes your computer run by managing how the hardware and software talk to each other. The team building this important software lost their tool for keeping track of code changes. So, Linus created Git—a tool to help his team organize their work, avoid confusion, and work together more easily.

Git was designed to solve real problems: version chaos, collaboration nightmares, and data loss.

His goals: make it fast, distributed, and trustworthy.

👉 Git wasn’t made to be fancy—it was made to keep developers sane.

🔍 Git vs GitHub Clarified:

Git

GitHub

A local tool on your computer

A website & cloud service

Tracks and manages changes in your files

Lets you store your Git repos online

Works completely offline

Used for collaboration & backups

Example: git commit, git merge

Example: git push, pull requests, Issues

Like using Google Docs offline

Like sharing your Docs with the team

➡️ Analogy:Think of Git as your personal notebook where you track your work.GitHub is like Google Drive—where you store that notebook so others can see or edit it.

🛠️ 2. Why Use Git & GitHub? (3 min)

✅ Production Use Cases

CI/CD deployment workflows

Source of truth for production code

Version control for collaborative coding

✅ Non-Production Use Cases

Scenario

Git/GitHub Value

Exploratory data work

Track and revert experiments easily

Collaboration

Prevent overwrites with clear history

Learning & teaching

Branch and review each other's notebooks or scripts

Reproducibility

Know which code version generated a specific result

Documentation

README, SQL/data dictionaries, project notes

🌽 3. Git Concepts via Cake Story (5 min)

The Great Cake Conflict

A group of roommates (devs) bake a cake (project) together, but at different times. They write the recipe on a whiteboard (repo).

Key Git Concepts:

Git Command

Cake Analogy

git clone

Copy the original recipe

branch

Make your own version to experiment

commit

Save your steps with a note

merge

Combine changes into one version

merge conflict

Two people edited the same step differently

Merge Conflict Example:

<<<<<<< HEAD
Add chocolate glaze before baking.
=======
Add strawberry topping after baking.
>>>>>>> strawberry-topping

➡️ Roommates must talk and resolve the conflict: layer both toppings or choose one.

⚙️ 4. What Makes Git Special (3 min)

Git's Design Principles:

Principle

What It Means

Full clones

Every copy has the full repo history (offline, backup-friendly)

SHA-1 checksums

Prevents silent data corruption (file contents = commit ID)

Cheap branching

Try ideas without messing up others' work

Frequent merging

Encourages collaboration, not isolation

Immutable history

Trace who changed what and when

🔍 You can even restore older CSVs or notebooks using git show!

💻 5. Quick Hands-On Demo (2 min)

🔎 Local Git Demo

“Everything we’re about to do is just on our machine. This is Git working offline. No GitHub yet.”

mkdir cake-repo && cd cake-repo
git init
echo "Step 1: Mix ingredients" > recipe.txt
git add .
git commit -m "Initial recipe"

# Add a topping
git checkout -b strawberry-topping
echo "Step 2: Add strawberry topping" >> recipe.txt
git commit -am "Add strawberry"

# Another topping
git checkout main
git checkout -b chocolate-glaze
echo "Step 2: Add chocolate glaze" >> recipe.txt
git commit -am "Add chocolate"

# Try merging
git checkout main
git merge strawberry-topping
git merge chocolate-glaze  # Causes conflict!

🔹 Optional GitHub Tie-in (if time allows)

“If I wanted to share this recipe so all of you could pull it down, I’d push it to GitHub like this:”

git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/cake-repo.git
git push -u origin main

“Now anyone could clone it and try their own toppings!”

📦 6. Recap: GitHub vs Git

Git

GitHub

Local version control tool

Cloud-based code hosting platform

Track, branch, and merge

Share, review, and collaborate

Fully offline capable

Accessible anywhere with internet

Personal sandbox

Teamwork and backup

🙇 7. Wrap-Up & Takeaways (1 min)

Remember:

Git helps you experiment without fear

GitHub helps you work together without chaos

Git is not just for production—it’s for any evolving project

Suggested Next Steps:

Try branching in your own repo

Use git log and git diff

Clone a teammate’s repo and explore the commit history
