Introduction 
Define Functions: Reusable blocks of code designed to perform a specific task.

Why use Functions:
Code Reusability: Write once, use multiple times.
Improved Clarity: Functions can make the main program easier to understand by abstracting complex logic.
Easier Debugging and Maintenance: Errors can be isolated to specific functions, and improvements can be made without affecting the main program.

When to Functionalize
Repetitive Code: Whenever you find yourself copying and pasting the same or similar blocks of code, it's a signal that this code should be encapsulated in a function.
Complex Operations: If a part of your code is complex or not immediately clear, encapsulating it in a function with a descriptive name can improve readability.
Conditional Logic: When your program uses complex conditional logic, breaking down these conditions into functions can make your code cleaner and easier to follow.
Reusability Across Projects: If a piece of code can be useful in multiple projects, turning it into a function in a shared library can save time in the future.
