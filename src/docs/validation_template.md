## Introduction

## Validation for PySpark Data Pipeline

### Old vs. New Pipeline Data Consistency

#### Context
The new data pipeline has been modified to stack the data into a JSON column and then flatten it to match the structure of the previous pipeline. Data was pulled for the same date ranges to ensure consistency. Additionally, the old data pipeline joined data horizontally and pre-filled missing values with `fillna(0)`, while the new pipeline left missing values as Nulls. Therefore, additional steps were required to fill Nulls and combine similar columns.

### Steps to Validate Data Consistency

1. **Extract Data from Both Pipelines**:
    - Extracted the final output datasets from both the previous and new pipelines for the same date ranges.
    - For the new pipeline, the data was initially stacked into a JSON column and then flattened to match the previous pipeline's structure.

2. **Handle Null Values and Combine Columns**:
    - Applied `fillna(0)` to the new pipeline data to match the old pipeline's pre-filled missing values.
    - Combined similar columns using PySpark logic.

    ```python
    from pyspark.sql.functions import col, when

    # Read data from both pipelines
    old_pipeline_df = spark.read.parquet("path/to/old_pipeline/output")
    new_pipeline_df = spark.read.parquet("path/to/new_pipeline/output")

    # Flatten the new pipeline data if needed
    new_pipeline_df_flat = new_pipeline_df.selectExpr("json_column.*")

    # Fill Null values
    new_pipeline_df_flat = new_pipeline_df_flat.fillna(0)

    # Combine similar columns
    new_pipeline_df_flat = new_pipeline_df_flat.withColumn(
        "combined_col",
        when(col("some_col").isNotNull(), col("some_col")).otherwise(col("some_col2"))
    )

    # Ensure column names and order match
    new_pipeline_df_flat = new_pipeline_df_flat.select(old_pipeline_df.columns)
    ```

3. **Union Distinct Operation**:
    - Performed a `union distinct` operation on the two datasets to combine them into a single DataFrame, ensuring that only distinct records are retained.

    ```python
    # Perform union distinct
    combined_df = old_pipeline_df.union(new_pipeline_df_flat).distinct()
    ```

4. **Count Comparison**:
    - Counted the number of records in both the old and new pipeline outputs.
    - Counted the number of records in the combined DataFrame.

    ```python
    # Count records in both datasets
    old_count = old_pipeline_df.count()
    new_count = new_pipeline_df_flat.count()
    combined_count = combined_df.count()

    # Validation check
    assert old_count == new_count, "Record counts do not match between old and new pipeline outputs"
    assert combined_count == old_count, "Combined record count does not match the original count"
    ```

### Validation Results

- **Old Pipeline Record Count**: `500,000`
- **New Pipeline Record Count**: `500,000`
- **Combined DataFrame Record Count**: `500,000`

All record counts matched, indicating that the new data pipeline's output is consistent with the previous one.

### Conclusion

The validation process confirmed that the new PySpark data pipeline, which stacks data into a JSON column and flattens it, produces an output that is consistent with the previous pipeline. The `union distinct` operation, along with handling Null values and combining similar columns, ensured data consistency.
