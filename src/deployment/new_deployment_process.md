### ðŸ“¦ Deployment Flow: Step-by-Step Breakdown

| Step | Platform/Tool       | Purpose                                    | Runs What                             | When It Runs                    | Code Type         |
|------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------|
| 1    | **SageMaker**       | Develop and test business logic             | Python module (`run()` in sproc)       | During development               | Business logic    |
| 2    | **GitHub**          | Source code management                      | Git repo (your project code)           | On code commit or PR merge       | N/A               |
| 3    | **GitHub Actions**  | Build and publish the package               | `setup.py` / `build.sh` (pip package)  | On push to `main` or release tag | Build pipeline    |
| 4    | **Artifactory**     | Store versioned Python packages             | `your_project-x.y.z.tar.gz`            | Always available                 | N/A               |
| 5    | **Harness**         | Deploy module to Snowflake                  | `main.py` (registers Snowflake objects)| On deployment trigger            | Deployment logic  |
| 6    | **Snowflake**       | Execute business logic inside the platform  | Stored Procedure (`run()` function)    | On task schedule (e.g., cron)    | Business logic    |


Plain-English Description for Docs/Stakeholders
Data engineers write and test Python code in SageMaker, then push it to GitHub.

GitHub Actions takes that code, builds a versioned artifact, and pushes it to Artifactory.

Harness is triggered to install the module and run a deployment script that creates objects in Snowflake: tables, stored procedures, and scheduled tasks.

Finally, Snowflake runs those stored procedures on a schedule â€” no further involvement from Harness is needed after deployment.
