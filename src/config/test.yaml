Subject: Formal HR Complaint – Workplace Bullying, Hostile Behavior, and Unfair Treatment
Dear [HR Representative's Name],

I am writing to formally file a complaint regarding workplace bullying, hostile behavior, and unfair treatment by my manager, [Manager’s Name]. Over the past several months, I have experienced a drastic and negative shift in how I am treated, which has affected my ability to work effectively.

I want to note that I have been hesitant to bring this forward sooner due to concerns about potential retaliation. Given my recent internal transfer, I now feel more comfortable documenting these issues without immediate fear of further negative repercussions. However, this experience has caused me significant anxiety since the beginning of the year, as I have felt bullied and uncomfortable communicating with [Manager’s Name].

1. Workplace Bullying and Hostile Behavior
Since November, [Manager’s Name] has consistently engaged in behavior that I believe constitutes workplace bullying, including:

Publicly criticizing my work in team meetings, claiming I was not following team standards. When I pointed out that similar tickets were handled the same way, she laughed and dismissed my response, saying, "There are always exceptions."
Citing undocumented standards as justification for criticism. She claimed that these exceptions were documented but never provided links or references.
Setting up a meeting specifically to reprimand me for helping a teammate with a SQL job, even though collaboration is a key part of our work.
Blocking my use of an open-source SQL optimizer (sqlglot), claiming it was "unapproved code," despite it being available through our internal PyPI repository. Our company regularly uses various Python libraries, and no clear policy was communicated to me regarding restrictions on using sqlglot.
Excluding me from meetings and leadership responsibilities without explanation despite my prior involvement in planning meetings with other team leads.
This behavior has created a hostile work environment, making it difficult to perform my job without fear of unjust criticism.

2. Exclusion from Leadership Responsibilities Without Explanation
Late last year, my manager discussed making me an unofficial lead for our Innovation & Automation projects, with another team member working under me.
I was actively involved in planning meetings with other team leads until December, but in January, I was suddenly excluded from these meetings without any explanation.
I was never informed that I was no longer leading the project, nor was any transition communicated to me.
My teammate, who has since taken over the project leadership role, has been acting more like a project manager. I assumed he was now the lead and have been following his direction and completing tasks he assigns, which he has consistently praised as high-quality work.
This lack of communication from my manager has caused confusion about my role and added to my anxiety about speaking with her, as she has provided no clarity on my standing in the project or why I was excluded.

3. Unequal Treatment in Return-to-Office Expectations
When we returned to the office, my manager verbally told me that I had to be in the office more frequently.
I pointed out that several team members come and go freely without issue.
She stated that their ability to leave was justified because they have children, but when I raised personal reasons for flexibility, she dismissed them as invalid.
There is nothing in company policy that allows parents more flexibility than other employees, yet she arbitrarily enforced different rules based on personal circumstances.
4. Unfair Disciplinary Action & Retaliation
About two weeks ago, I informed [Manager’s Name] that I intended to transfer internally.
Shortly after, she issued a disciplinary action: Unsatisfactory Performance, citing concerns that had never previously been raised.
The duration of the disciplinary action was added after the fact, and her time estimates for ticket completion were unrealistic, assuming they should take only a few hours.
Additionally, my manager included my vacation time when assessing my work duration, making it appear as though I had been working on tickets for longer than I actually had. This misrepresentation unfairly impacted my evaluation.
This new, undisclosed performance standard appears to be applied selectively and was never discussed with me as a measurement of my work prior to this.

5. Request for HR Review
Given the pattern of bullying, inconsistent expectations, exclusion, and sudden changes in performance evaluations, I am requesting that HR:

Investigate the workplace bullying and hostile behavior I have been experiencing.
Review the fairness of the disciplinary action, given the inconsistent expectations, unrealistic time estimates, and the inclusion of vacation time in performance assessment.
Clarify whether this disciplinary action is recorded in my work history and how it may impact my future opportunities.
Investigate why I was removed from leadership discussions without explanation and whether this was an intentional exclusion.
Address the unequal enforcement of return-to-office policies, particularly the preferential treatment of certain employees over others without a clear company policy.
Investigate potential retaliation, as the disciplinary action was issued shortly after I disclosed my transfer plans.
Please let me know the next steps for formally documenting this complaint and any potential resolution options. I appreciate your time in reviewing this matter and look forward to your response.
