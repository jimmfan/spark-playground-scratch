# Comparison of Plans for Resolving Small File Problem in HDFS

## Plan 1: Adjust Hive and Hadoop Settings, Rewriting Tables with Updated Configurations
You intend to update the Hive and Hadoop configurations to manage small files more efficiently without changing partitioning.

### Pros:
1. **Preserves existing partitioning logic**: If partitioning is still beneficial for queries (e.g., faster retrieval for specific dates), this plan retains that functionality.
2. **Less disruption to existing pipelines**: Adjusting backend configurations minimizes the need for updating multiple data ingestion pipelines.
3. **Efficient small file handling**: Merging small files, optimizing dynamic partitioning, and enabling parallel execution can reduce the number of small files and improve overall efficiency.
4. **Snappy compression and larger block sizes**: These settings ensure efficient data compression and larger block sizes, improving read performance and reducing storage overhead.
5. **Parallel execution**: Enabling Hive parallel execution can improve processing performance, especially with large datasets.

### Cons:
1. **Dependent on tuning effectiveness**: The success of this approach relies on how well the configuration settings work with your specific datasets.
2. **Potentially complex rewrites**: Rewriting tables can be resource-intensive and time-consuming for large datasets.
3. **Risk of not fully solving the problem**: Some small files might still exist, and performance may not be optimal in certain cases.
4. **Config complexity**: Managing and adjusting numerous Hive/Hadoop settings introduces long-term complexity.

## Plan 2: Rewriting Tables Without Partitions and Using `unionByName` to Overwrite Non-Partitioned Tables
In this plan, you would remove partitioning altogether and update pipelines to read and union new data with the existing data, overwriting the non-partitioned tables.

### Pros:
1. **No partition management overhead**: Removing partitions eliminates the complexity and overhead associated with maintaining them.
2. **Simplified data processing**: Queries and updates may become simpler since you donâ€™t need to handle partition-specific logic.
3. **Control over table size**: Using `unionByName`, you can better control the size of the final written files and consolidate data more effectively.
4. **Reduced file fragmentation**: Non-partitioned tables are more likely to result in fewer, larger files, which may address the small file issue.

### Cons:
1. **Loss of partitioning benefits**: Removing partitions could negatively impact query performance, particularly for queries that benefit from partition pruning.
2. **Pipeline updates required**: You will need to update all pipelines to read the existing data and perform `unionByName`, adding complexity to ETL workflows.
3. **Table size increases over time**: As the table grows without partitions, queries could become slower, leading to more expensive operations.
4. **Potential bottlenecks**: Depending on data size and frequency of updates, the `unionByName` approach could introduce performance bottlenecks.

## Summary Comparison

| **Criteria**                      | **Plan 1: Adjust Settings**                      | **Plan 2: Non-Partitioned Tables**                 |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Partitioning**                  | Retained (optimized)                             | Removed                                           |
| **Query Performance**             | Potentially better for specific ranges (due to partitioning) | Could slow down over time (full table scans)      |
| **Pipeline Impact**               | Minimal changes required                         | Requires updates to all pipelines                 |
| **File Size Control**             | Handled through tuning and compression settings  | Controlled by union logic                         |
| **Maintenance**                   | Continuous tuning of configs                     | Potentially simpler, but slower over time         |
| **Risk of Small Files**           | Reduced, but tuning-dependent                    | Greatly reduced, more deterministic               |
| **Performance Consistency**       | Variable depending on partitioning and settings  | Could degrade as table grows                      |

## Recommendation:
- **If query performance on specific partitions (e.g., dates) is critical**, and you want to minimize disruption to your existing pipelines, **Plan 1 (adjusting settings)** is recommended.
- **If simplifying data management and eliminating partition-related issues is more important**, and you can afford slower queries over time, **Plan 2 (removing partitions)** may be a better option, especially if small file issues are a critical problem.
