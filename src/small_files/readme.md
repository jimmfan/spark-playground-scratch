Plan 1: Adjusting Hive and Hadoop Settings, Rewriting Tables with Updated Configurations
You intend to update the Hive and Hadoop configurations to manage small files more efficiently without changing partitioning.

Pros:
Preserves existing partitioning logic: If partitioning is still beneficial for queries (e.g., faster retrieval for specific dates), this plan retains that functionality.
Less disruption to existing pipelines: Since you are adjusting backend configurations rather than changing table structures or pipelines, it minimizes the need for updating multiple data ingestion pipelines.
Efficient small file handling: The combination of merging small files, optimizing dynamic partitioning, and parallel execution can significantly reduce the number of small files and improve overall efficiency.
Snappy compression and larger block sizes: These settings will ensure that data is efficiently compressed and written in larger blocks, improving read performance and reducing storage overhead.
Parallel execution: By enabling Hive parallel execution, you may improve processing performance, especially when working with large datasets.
Cons:
Dependent on tuning effectiveness: Success depends on how well the configuration settings work with your specific datasets. You may still have to tweak these settings over time to optimize performance.
Potentially complex rewrites: Rewriting tables, even with optimized settings, can be resource-intensive and time-consuming for large datasets, especially if you need to do it frequently.
Risk of not fully solving the problem: While tuning helps, there could still be some edge cases where small files continue to exist or where performance is not optimal, especially if partitioning leads to many small partitions.
Config complexity: Keeping track of and adjusting numerous Hive/Hadoop settings can introduce complexity in managing the environment long-term.
Plan 2: Rewriting Tables Without Partitions and Using unionByName to Overwrite Non-Partitioned Tables
In this plan, you would remove partitioning altogether and update pipelines to read and union new data with the existing data, overwriting the non-partitioned tables.

Pros:
No partition management overhead: By removing partitions, you eliminate the complexity and overhead associated with maintaining and managing them, particularly when partitions lead to small file creation.
Simplified data processing: Without partitions, queries and updates might become simpler to manage since you don’t need to handle partition-specific logic, like managing partition keys or dynamic partition inserts.
Control over table size: By rewriting and unioning the data with unionByName, you have better control over the size of the final written file, allowing you to consolidate the data more effectively.
Reduced file fragmentation: With non-partitioned tables, there’s a higher chance of fewer, larger files being created, which may help resolve the small file issue more effectively.
Cons:
Loss of partitioning benefits: Removing partitions might negatively affect query performance, especially if you query specific ranges of data (e.g., date partitions). Instead of benefiting from partition pruning, the entire table would need to be scanned for queries.
Pipeline updates required: You will need to modify all pipelines to read the existing data and perform unionByName. This adds a layer of complexity to your ETL workflows and could introduce additional processing overhead.
Table size increases over time: As the table grows larger with more data and no partitioning, queries on the entire table could become slow over time, potentially leading to more expensive operations or requiring more frequent maintenance.
Potential bottlenecks: Depending on the size of your data and the frequency of data updates, the unionByName approach could lead to bottlenecks, especially if you're overwriting large tables often.
Summary Comparison:
Criteria	Plan 1: Adjust Settings	Plan 2: Non-Partitioned Tables
Partitioning	Retained (optimized)	Removed
Query Performance	Potentially better for specific ranges (due to partitioning)	Could slow down over time (full table scans)
Pipeline Impact	Minimal changes required	Requires updates to all pipelines
File Size Control	Handled through tuning and compression settings	Controlled by union logic
Maintenance	Continuous tuning of configs	Potentially simpler, but slower over time
Risk of Small Files	Reduced, but tuning-dependent	Greatly reduced, more deterministic
Performance Consistency	Variable depending on partitioning and settings	Could degrade as table grows
Recommendation:
If query performance on specific partitions (e.g., dates) is critical, and you want to minimize disruption to your existing pipelines, Plan 1 (adjusting settings) would be the better approach. It allows you to retain partitioning while optimizing small file management.
If simplifying your data management and eliminating partition-related issues is more important, and you can afford slower queries in the long run, Plan 2 (removing partitions) may be a better option, especially if small file issues are critical and frequent.
